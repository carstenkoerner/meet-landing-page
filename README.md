## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned: 
- to use grid and flex in the same project
- to apply a colour effect to a background image
- to use the Lunacy app to work with Sketch files

### Continued development

To work with Sketch Files is a big plus for getting my projects more exactly to the template. I will continue to do so.

### Useful resources

- [https://icons8.de/lunacy](https://icons8.de/lunacy) - This native app is really cool and for free.
